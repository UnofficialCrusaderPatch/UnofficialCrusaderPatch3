ai_housing: Smarter housing management
ai_housing_descr: Let the AI lords manage their housing smarter by adjusting their criteria when to stop building new houses and preventing the AI to delete houses all together. This generally lets the AI expand faster and spawn new workers quicker at the beginning of the game.
ai_build_housing: Adjust empty space for peasants to spawn
ai_build_housing_descr: |
  Adjust when AIs will stop building houses by their still available empty space for new peasants. In vanilla this value is 0, hence the AI is only building new houses if all houses are fully populated.
  This option also prevents the AIs from demolishing their extra houses.
ai_campfire_housing: Adjust room for idle peasants at the campfire
ai_campfire_housing_descr: |
  Adjust the maximum amount of peasants at the AIs' campfires, before the AIs stop building new houses.
  This option also prevents the AIs from demolishing their extra houses.
ai_delete_housing: This option exclusively prevents the AIs from demolishing their extra houses.
ai_demolish: Demolishing buildings for money
ai_demolish_descr: |
  If the AIs feel pressured, they demolish their economy or fortification buildings to get quick money for troops. This feature sometimes seems to be triggered without any visible reason and demolishing these buildings is often a bad strategy. The following types of demolishing buildings for money can be disabled.
ai_demolish_eco: Econonmy buildings
ai_demolish_trapped: Inaccessible buildings
ai_demolish_walls: Fortification buildings
ai_access: No demolishing of inaccessible buildings
ai_access_descr: |
  The AI will no longer demolish and rebuild its buildings continuously, when they can't be reached by a worker.
ai_addattack: Change the increase of army per attack wave
ai_addattack_descr: |
  In vanilla each AI lord increases their army by 5 additional units for each main attack. You can adjust the amount here.
ai_addattack_alt_descr: |
  Alternatively, you can let the AI lords increase their army by a percentage of their initial army size, which is unique for each lord.
  Example: Scale factor = 0.5
  Sultan's attack troops = 10, 15, 20, 25, ... 
  Saladin's attack troops = 50, 75, 100, 125, ...
ai_assaultswitch: Disable AI switching attack targets during a siege
ai_assaultswitch_descr: |
  AIs with the target choice set to gold or weakest were sometimes reevaluating who they would attack in the midst of a siege, running their troops across the whole map. With this fix, the AI will stick with their previously chosen target.
ai_attacklimit: Adjust AI limit for recruiting attack troops
ai_attacklimit_descr: |
  The AI's number of main army units are capped at the size of their first attack plus this value (200 in vanilla). After reaching this limit, the AI stops recruiting troops and no longer sends out main attacks.
  NOTE: Very high values can cause the global unit limit to be reached in longer games, resulting in peasants being unable to spawn.
ai_attacktarget: Override AI attack targets
ai_attacktarget_descr: |
  You can override how all AI lords choose their attack targets.
  NOTE: There is a more granular way to set individual attack target behaviour for AIs inside the AIC by using the aiSwapper module.
ai_attacktarget_nearest: Closest enemy
ai_attacktarget_richest: Richest enemy
ai_attacktarget_weakest: Weakest enemy
ai_attackwave: More active AI attacking behaviour
ai_attackwave_descr: |
  In vanilla the AI only sends out a single soldier per wallpiece in an attack and the rest of the army wait until a wallsegment is free again if there are more troops than avaviable walltile. 
  this option will allow the AI to send multiple Units per wallsegment to take them down faster and will also have units attack buildings and towers which were previously ignored.
  Additionally the Ai will also send all its remaining attack troops to the enemy keep once the walls have been breached.
# we are adding a suboption here for army part split off to attack economy!
ai_buywood: Buy additional wood
ai_buywood_descr: |
  In vanilla, the AIs when constructing a building are only stocking up on wood to match the exact price of the building they are about to construct. This leaves no buffer for active weapon production consuming wood. To prevent this issue, 2 additional wood are stocked up by the AI in this case.
ai_defense: More reliable repleneshing of castle defenders
ai_defense_descr: |
  Fixes a bug which stopped the AI from replacing missing troops on walls and towers, as long as defensive patrols were still around.
ai_fix_crusader_archers_pitch: Enable European archers to light pitch
ai_fix_crusader_archers_pitch_descr: |
  AI's European archers light pitch the same way Arabian archers do, when defending against enemy units.
ai_fix_laddermen_with_enclosed_keep: Enable enclosed AIs to deploy laddermen
ai_fix_laddermen_with_enclosed_keep_descr: |
  AIs no longer stop assaulting enemy walls with their Laddermen if their own keep is enclosed.
ai_nosleep: Disable sleep mode for production facilities
ai_nosleep_descr: |
  The AI lords put their production buildings to sleep, if they run out of a resources they depend on for their Industry. E.g. all bakers are put to sleep when Saladin runs out of flour. 
  However, this often disregards goods still being processed or midst their delivery leading to a constant loss of goods.
  Here you can disable this sleep mode for the AI entirely.
ai_resources_rebuy: Improve AI restocking of needed goods
ai_resources_rebuy_descr: |
  The AI often doesn't restock goods even if it has the gold for it, leaving its production chains running dry. This option reduces the amount of time the AI waits for its stocks to be empty before restocking the necessary goods.
ai_noflour_maxtime_descr: |
  Time in 1/12th of months until the AI restocks 2 flour.
ai_noiron_maxtime_descr: |
  Time in 1/12th of months until the AI restocks 2 iron.
ai_nowood_maxtime_descr: |
  Time in 1/12th of months until the AI restocks 5 wood.
ai_rebuild: Improved AI repairs
ai_rebuild_descr: |
  With this setting the AIs will replace tower ruins and slightly damaged walls. They will also overbuild gathering grounds of recruitment buildings if their main building went missing.
ai_recruitinterval: Override and maximize recruitment speed
ai_recruitinterval_descr: |
  Sets the recruitment interval of all AIs to the lowest value, recruiting as fast as the Vanilla Rat/Richard.
  NOTE: There is a more granular way to set individual recruitment speed for AIs AIC using the aiSwapper module.
ai_recruitstate_initialtimer: Set AIs initial time until they recruit according to the AIC parameters
ai_recruitstate_initialtimervalue_descr: |
  Adjust the number of months for which the AI will exclusively recruit defence troops, unless its pool of defense units is full. In vanilla this period spans over 6 months.
ai_tethers: Set ox tethers to a maximum of 10 per AI lord
ai_tethers_descr: |
  Usually, the AI builds a new ox tether for every new quarry it constructs, even if it exceeds the usual limit of 10 ox tethers per lord. This can lead to a spam of ox tethers, reaching the housing limit for an AI lord causing no new peasants to spawn. With this setting you can disable the placement of that extra ox tether when a new quarry is built.
ai_towerengines: Increase the siege engine limit of the AI
ai_towerengines_descr: |
  Usually the AI only builds up to three mangonels and ballistas on its towers. With this option this limit is increased to 5 per engine.
fix_apple_orchard_build_size: Shrink apple orchard's build size
fix_apple_orchard_build_size_descr: |
  Changes the apple orchard's build preview to the size it occupies after the farm is placed down. This saves some space when building apple orchards and makes it easier for the AI to find space to place them on oasisgrass.
o_armory_marketplace_weapon_order_fix: Match armory/marketplace weapon order
o_armory_marketplace_weapon_order_fix_descr: |
  Reorders weapon icons in the the marketplace to be the same as in the armory. This includes the switching of pages in the market, as well as the display in the main category.

  (however, the tent itself is still not centered at the location designated in the AIV editor).
o_default_multiplayer_speed: Set default multiplayer speed
o_default_multiplayer_speed_descr: Allows to set the default multiplayer speed, which also is enabled upon loading the game instead of the default speed of 40.
o_disable_border_scrolling: Disable border scrolling via mouse cursor
o_disable_border_scrolling_descr: |
  Moving the cursor to the edge of the screen will no longer move the camera.
  NOTE: This option is designed to be used in windowed mode, when you are moving your mouse out of the window to do other things.
o_engineertent: Continious siege tent placement
o_engineertent_descr: |
  This option allows the player to continuously place siegeengines down, without the game automatically deselecting the engine after the tent has been placed.
o_fast_placing: Continious placement for common buildings

  Holding your left mouse button down will continuously place the following buildings:
  Killing pits, woodcutters, good & bad things, mills, water pots, bakeries and hovels

  Bakers no longer disappear when they don't find flour at their targeted stockpile.
o_fix_fletcher_bug: Fix fletchers inefficient pathing
o_fix_fletcher_bug_descr: |
  Fixes the behaviour where fletchers would go back to their workplace after delivering the bow/crossbow at the armory, instead of going straight to the stockpile to grab wood for the next production cycle.
o_fix_ladderclimb: Units climbing ladders retain their move command target
o_fix_ladderclimb_descr: |
  Units will keep remembering their original destination after climbing a ladder, instead of getting stuck on the ladders and just waiting on the walltile they climbed up onto.
o_fix_map_sending: Enable map sending for multiplayer
o_fix_map_sending_descr: |
  Reduces the length of the sent map name, to make map sending possible again.

  Deleting buildings with a fast auto clicker no longer deletes the building multiple times. This way you dont get more resources back from deleting than the game has intended.
o_freetrader: Free trading post
o_freetrader_descr: |
  This option makes the trading post cost no resources to prevent the AI from getting stuck due to not having enough resources to build the marketplace. In multiplayer games, this prevents the need to restart entirely or demolish buildings for wood when a trading post is forgotten.
o_gamespeed: Extended game speed limits
o_gamespeed_descr: |
  Enable the change of the gamespeed as follows:
  - From 10 to 90 in intervals of 5

o_healer_descr: |
  The healer of the apothecary building now actively seeks out injured soldiers, siegeengines, civilians and animals to heal them. The nearest targets are treated first. With each healing animation about 1/3 of a spearman's health is recovered. The strolling through gardens and investigation of plague clouds is not replaced. 
  Only the strolling through the castle is skipped until no more wounded targets are in the area.
o_increase_path_update_tick_rate: Check more often for available paths
o_increase_path_update_tick_rate_descr: |
  In vanilla, it took 200 game ticks to check for new pathing being avaviable, often stopping units to move into the castle after destroying a gate or tower immediately.
  Change the calcualtion of availability to every 50 gameticks, allowing the units to 'realize' new paths being avaviable more quickly.
o_keys: Move camera with WASD-Keys and enable quicksaves

#o_seed_modification_possibility_only_set_descr: |
#  'Setting the Game seed will allow
#  AI-only games to play out the same way if the same map settings are used. For games involving human players, it will ensure the same starting conditions in the map (e.g. AIV selection).
